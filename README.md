# Circed - IRCD (deamon) in Crystal

This an crystal IRC server made to follow the spec over time. Right now it is not 100% supporting the spec and is not recommended for production.

## What you can do now:
* let user connect
* Send MOTD and stats to the user
* PING/PONG with disconnection after 10 unanswered PINGS.

## Plan to have:
* Channels
* chan modes
* User modes
* GLines support
* Resolve ip address and lookup for bans
* Server OPs
* SSL TLS support
* NickServ
* ChanServ
* Server-to-server communication
* Simple config in YML
